# Summary

This script converts Cisco ASA configuration to Palo Alto configuration.
It will read from the following source files: source_cisco_objectgroups.txt and source_cisco_acl
The input from the cisco source files (generated by running "show run" commands on your source cisco device) and converts them to (or, more correctly, generates) a series of commands that will be needed for running on the Palo Alto device you are attempting to migrate to.

Currently, the script generates Palo Alto set commands for:
 - object groups
 - ACLs


## From the help arg output: 
The output is written to the (specified) file (or default: ./palo_alto_setcommands.sh).
# Options:
-     --h: Show Help Menu (this)
      --a: Append or overwrite current output shell script file (Default: Overwrite)
      --f: The file path to append content to (Default: \'palo_alto_setcommands.sh\' in  director')
# Example Usage:
-     python app.py --h (shows this help menu)
      python app.py --a (appends to output file, and uses default file path for output)
      python app.py --f /path/to/output-file.sh (specified output file (follows default logic to overwrite if file exists))
      python app.py --a --f /path/to/output-file.sh  (appends to output file, and uses specified file path for output.)
